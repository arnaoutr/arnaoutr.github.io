          This can occur by drilling down—understanding the genetic and cellular
          mechanism of a particular disease—or going broad, using computational
          means to analyze precision phenotypes at scale. Dr. Arnaout is
          currently developing computational methods to bring precision
          phenotyping to medical imaging. Her background as a
          physician-scientist informs the future scope of this work as a
          technology that can transform non-invasive imaging into a big-data
          tool for both research and clinical use. She also uses animal and in
          vitro models to study cardiovascular gene function and to model human
          cardiovascular disease.
