<br>

We are hiring a data scientist with mid-career skills and experience. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis.<br>

**ABOUT.** The Arnaout laboratory studies deep learning and other computational methods for biomedical imaging and related clinical data, with the goals of decreasing diagnostic error and developing and scaling novel phenotypes to drive precision medicine. UCSF is a top-10 medical center and a leader in cross-campus efforts to mine, harmonize, and analyze multi-modal clinical data for the University of California’s 15 million patients. The Arnaout laboratory is part of both the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute and the nationally ranked Department of Medicine. Projects focus on deep learning for medical imaging, and through collaborative work with intra- and inter-institutional partners, also involve the electronic health record, genetics, and other data types.<br>

**POSITION.** The data scientist position offers an opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research with transformational impact to clinical and research medicine across a wide array of diseases, working with decades of high-quality medical data alongside clinical domain experts. The position also provides opportunities to publish, present at research conferences, and for professional advancement. Salary and benefits are set according to experience and to UCSF salary scales.<br>

**CONTACT.** Inquiries should be emailed directly to Dr. Arnaout and should include a CV and a clear but brief letter of interest.<br>
