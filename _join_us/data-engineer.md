**Data Engineer Position in Arnaout Laboratory at UCSF**
<br>

We are hiring a data engineer with mid-career skills and experience. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis.<br>

**ABOUT.** The Arnaout laboratory studies deep learning and other computational methods for biomedical imaging and related clinical data, with the goals of decreasing diagnostic error and developing and scaling novel phenotypes to drive precision medicine. UCSF is a top-10 medical center and a leader in cross-campus efforts to mine, harmonize, and analyze multi-modal clinical data for the University of California’s 15 million patients. The Arnaout laboratory is part of both the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, the Center for Intelligent Imaging, and the nationally ranked Department of Medicine. Projects focus on deep learning for medical imaging, and through collaborative work with intra- and inter-institutional partners, also involve the electronic health record, genetics, and other data types.<br>

**POSITION.** The data engineer position offers an opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research with transformational impact to clinical and research medicine across a wide array of diseases. The data engineer will design and implement data solutions across the research lifecycle, optimizing how both data scientists and clinican experts interact with the data. The ideal candidate will be interested in backend (automating and scaling data mining, processing, transfer, storage) and some frontend (containerization, visualizations, webapps) work. They will be working with decades of high-quality medical data. The position also provides opportunities to publish, present at research conferences, and for professional advancement. Salary and benefits are set according to experience and to UCSF salary scales.<br>
