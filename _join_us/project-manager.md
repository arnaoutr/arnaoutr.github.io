**Project Manager Position in Arnaout Laboratory at UCSF**
<br>

We are hiring a project manager for data science with early-to-mid career skills and experience.<br>

**ABOUT.** The Arnaout laboratory studies deep learning and other computational methods for biomedical imaging and related clinical data, with the goals of decreasing diagnostic error and developing and scaling novel phenotypes to drive precision medicine. UCSF is a top-10 medical center and a leader in cross-campus efforts to mine, harmonize, and analyze multi-modal clinical data for the University of California’s 15 million patients. The Arnaout laboratory is part of both the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute and the nationally ranked Department of Medicine. Projects focus on deep learning for medical imaging, and through collaborative work with intra- and inter-institutional partners, also involve the electronic health record, genetics, and other data types.<br>

**POSITION.** The successful candidate will work closely with the Principal Investigator and team to coordinate data science research projects; organize and maintain computational and clinical operating procedures; and coordinate communications for the laboratory. The project manager position offers an opportunity to manage medical data science projects across the entire life cycle, from data mining PHI and interacting with clinicians to organizing data processing and analysis tasks, communicating with clinical and technical collaborators, and integrating findings into the clinical context. Salary and benefits are set according to experience and to UCSF salary scales.<br>
